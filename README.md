# INDENG142_Sp25

This repository contains the final project for **INDENG 142A (Spring 2025)** at UC Berkeley. The project focuses on analyzing customer data using machine learning techniques to uncover insights and improve business decision-making.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### Data Files
- `Data.csv`: Raw customer data.
- `aggregated_customer_data.csv`: Cleaned and aggregated version of customer data.

### Notebooks for EDA & Feature Engineering
- `EDA_Feature_Eng.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and transformation of raw features.
- `Aggregated_customer_data.ipynb`: Analysis on cleaned/aggregated features.

### Modeling Notebooks

#### Linear & Logistic Models
- `Linear_regression.ipynb`: Linear regression on raw data.
- `Aggregated_Linear_Reg.ipynb`: Linear regression on aggregated data.
- `Logistic_regression.ipynb`: Logistic regression on raw data.
- `Aggregated_LogisticRegression.ipynb`: Logistic regression on aggregated data.

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- `142a_KNN_Regression+Classifcation.ipynb`: KNN regression and classification on raw data.
- `KNN_AggData_Regression+Classification-1.ipynb`: KNN on aggregated data.

#### Random Forest
- `Rand_Forest.ipynb`: Random Forest implementation on raw data.
- `aggregated_Random_forest.ipynb`: Random Forest on aggregated data.

#### Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
- `PCA_KMeans_Module.ipynb`: PCA and KMeans clustering on raw data.
- `Aggregated_PCA_KMeans.ipynb`: PCA and KMeans clustering on aggregated data.

### Visual Assets
- `3DPCACluster.png`: 3D PCA visualization of customer clusters.

## üìä Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns in customer behavior.
- Engineer meaningful features from raw data.
- Apply machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering.
- Compare model performance across raw vs. aggregated datasets.
- Visualize clustering and feature relationships for interpretability.
